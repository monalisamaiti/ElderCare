            Volunteering allows you to connect to your community and make it a better place. Even helping out with the smallest tasks can make a real difference to the lives of people, animals, and organizations in need. And, volunteering is a two-way street: It can benefit you and your family as much as the cause you choose to help. Dedicating your time as a volunteer helps you make new friends, expand your network, and boost your social skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Volunteering can boost your self-confidence, self-esteem, and life satisfaction. You are working for the welfare of the community, which provides a sense of accomplishment. Your role as a volunteer also gives you a sense of pride and identity, and the better you feel about yourself, the more likely you are to have a positive view of your life and future goals.
        The social aspect of volunteering is important for seniors.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the best benefits of volunteering for seniors is personal growth. After all, getting older doesn’t mean that personal growth has to come to an end. Volunteering is a great way to discover new experiences and various point of views.
        As you volunteer more, you might start to feel a higher sense of purpose and fulfilment from your life. It’s a chance to break out of your daily routine and expand your horizons. Ageing is a natural part of life and volunteering can help you recapture that sense of wonder and personal progress you felt when you were younger.
        </p>
        <p>Volunteering is a serious commitment. You have to remember that you are saying yes to certain responsibilities and tasks assigned to you when needed. People will depend on you to do your job well. So before you commit, be clear about your rights and responsibilities as a volunteer.</p>
